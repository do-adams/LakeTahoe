**Lake Tahoe** is a simple responsive website I built throughout April 2017 while completing the [CSS Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics) course on Team Treehouse. It is designed to show off some of the beautiful scenery from Lake Tahoe, California via the use of modern web development practices.

You can view it live [here](https://do-adams.github.io/LakeTahoe/), courtesy of GitHub Pages.
